### function
Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result.
the function is stoped when reaches a return statement.

### Why we use Functions?

* You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

 *You can use the same code many times with different arguments.

### Defining functions

### 1. Function declarations

#### * function square(number) {
#### return number * number;}

### 2. Function expressions

#### var square = function(number) { return number * number }

### Calling function
you can call function from call the name of function such as :
#### name()
if thire any parameters you can add it.
#### name(25)

#### diferent between Function declarations and Function expressions
in the Function declarations you can call function before the function statment.

in the Function expressions you can't call function before the function statment.

### Control flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
