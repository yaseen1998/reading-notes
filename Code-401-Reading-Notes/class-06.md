## Random functions
### How to use the Random Module
we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list,

### how to use and generat random library
 first call **import random**
 
### some function in random 
* **Randint** : If we wanted a random integer, (random.randint(0, 5))
* **random** : If you want a larger number (random.random() * 100)
* **choice** : Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
* **shuffle** : The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
* **Randrange** : Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)


# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
Risk: The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as
In Software Testing:
Risk: analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.
## Possible risks that could be encounter?
1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources for the application
## Risks that are unavoidable
1. The time that you allocated for testing
2. A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
3. Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
4. Incomplete requirements
## Risk magnitude indicators
1. High.
2. Medium.
3. Low.
## Risk Identification
There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:
1. Business Risks.
2. Testing Risks.
3. Premature Release Risk.
4. Software Risks

## How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:
1. Searching the risk
2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
3. Measures for the risk identified

## BIG O notation
### type : 
* O(1): a statement will execute one time
* O(n): a statement will execute more than one time will execute nth of time.

rule : 
* two different steps O(A)+O(B)=O(A+B)
* drop contants
* different inputs = different variables
* drop non-dominate terms
