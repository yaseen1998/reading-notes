## Pain vs. Suffering
That accelerated learning environment is great, but it does come at a price that is felt in all spheres of life: physical, mental, and emotional.That price is pain, the pain of growth.
<br>
You’ll Constantly be thrust far outside of your comfort zone with the expectation that you’ll survive for the next push forward.
 <br>
 <br>
 All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing, as long as that pain is what’s necessary to achieve the growth that you’re aiming for. And even better than that, this pain is only temporary. It’s what will launch you forward into the next phase of your life.
 <br>
 <br>
 Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.
Suffering is dependent on the story that we layer on top of our pain

## Big O notation
 notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
 Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.
 <br>
 ### some type of Big O notation
 * O(1) : describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
 * O(N) : describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
 * O(N²) : epresents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
 * O(2^N) : denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. 

## Names and Values in Python
symbolic name on the left-hand side with a value on the right-hand side. In Python, we say that names refer to values, or a name is a reference to a value

<br>
<hr>
There’s no rule that says a value can only have one name. An assignment statement can make a second (or third, ...) name refer to the same value.
x = 23
y = x
Now x and y both refer to the same value
<br>
<hr>
Python keeps track of how many references each value has, and automatically cleans up values that have none. This is called “garbage collection,”

An important fact about assignment: assignment never copies data.
When values have more than one name, it’s easy to get confused and think of it as two names and two values:
