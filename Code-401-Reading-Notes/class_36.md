## Whiteboard advice
The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! 
<br>
### What Do You Mean Communicate?
* **First, Restate the Question** 
The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand. 
* **Ask About Edge Cases**
Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. 

* **Ask About Test Cases**
simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass

### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic.

<br>
Super bonus: If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code, you have actually earned a lot of points by now! Sure

### Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.

### Stuck? Ask for Help!
If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally

### Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview
ou should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview. Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the interview? Ask them! Furthermore, you can ask if there is anything in particular you should prepare. 

## 7 tips to ace a programming interview
* **1) Take a few minutes.**
Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.
* **2) Write down the steps of the solution.**
* **3) Write pseudocode first.**
* **4) Don’t sweat the small stuff.**
Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet.
* **5) Sit down. Be humble.**
* **6) Come prepared.**
* **7) Review your work.**
