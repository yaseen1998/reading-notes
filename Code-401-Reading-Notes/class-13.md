### Linear Regression in Python
#### Regression
Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. 
<br>
find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.
The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.
<br>
The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.

#### When Do You Need Regression?
you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. 
<br>
Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. 
#### Linear Regression
Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques.
#### Problem Formulation

#### Regression Performance
The coefficient of determination, denoted as 𝑅², tells you which amount of variation in 𝑦 can be explained by the dependence on 𝐱 using the particular regression model. 
<br>
The value 𝑅² = 1 corresponds to SSR = 0, that is to the perfect fit since the values of predicted and actual responses fit completely to each other.
#### Underfitting and Overfitting
* Underfitting occurs when a model can’t accurately capture the dependencies among data, usually as a consequence of its own simplicity. 
<br>
* Overfitting happens when a model learns both dependencies among data and random fluctuations
