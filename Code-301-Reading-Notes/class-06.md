## What Is Node.js?
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking,
asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

## In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome 
and other Chromium-based web browsers,
including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.<br>
when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, 
we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. 

## What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
 this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax.
 It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues —
 as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.
 
 ## What is npm?
Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm.<br>
npm is also the world’s largest software registry.

## What version of node are you running on your machine?
6.14.15
## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
`npm install -g jshint`<br>
`jshint index.js`<br>

## What is node used for?
installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools
— designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
* 1. Greater efficiency
* 2. Engaged collaboration
* 3. Learning from fellow students
* 4. Social skills
* 5. Job interview readiness
* 6. Work environment readiness

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
 Social skills because . When working with someone who has a different coding style,
 communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have
 different personalities.
 
 ## How does pair programming work?
 pair programming commonly involves two roles:
 the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one
 whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text
 editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.<br>
 The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct 
 input to the computer.
