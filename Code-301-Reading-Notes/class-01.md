# Component-Based Architecture

Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components 
that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods<br>
The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability

### What is a component?
#### 1-Views of a Component
* Object-oriented view
* Conventional view
* Process-related view

#### 2-Characteristics of Components
* Reusability 
* Replaceable 
* Not context specific
* Extensible 
* Encapsulated 
* Independent 

#### 3-Principles of Component−Based Design
#### 4-Component-Level Design Guidelines
#### 5-Conducting Component-Level Design
###### Advantages
* Ease of deployment
* Reduced cost
* Ease of development
* Reusable 
* Modification of technical complexity
* Reliability
* System maintenance and evolution
* Independent

### Graphical User Interface
it's moxt common user interface because it makes use of pictures, graphics, and icons - hence why it is called 'graphical'.
<br>
it called <b> WIMP interface (Windows,Icons,Menus,Poiner) </b>

### Design of User Interface 
to understand the Design of User Interface you must know <br>
<b> user </b> who will interact with the system through the interface <br>
<b> tasks</b> that end users must perform to do their work <br><b> 
<b> content</b> that is presented as part of the interface<br>
<b> work</b> environment in which these tasks will be conducted<br>

####  The design of a user interface is often divided into four different levels −
* conceptual level
* semantic level
* syntactic level
* lexical level

### User Interface Development Process
#### Interface analysis
#### Interface design
#### Interface construction
#### Interface validation
#### User Interface Models
#### User profile model
#### Design model
#### Implementation model
#### User's mental model

#### Design Considerations of User Interface
<b> User centered / Simple and Intuitive / Place Users in Control / Transparency</b> <br>
<b> Use progressive disclosure / Consistency / Integration </b>


# React JS
React is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces
### What is props short for?
Props is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is
being used for passing data from one component to another.
<br>
that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow
<br>
props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

### How are props used in React?
* Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
* Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
* Finally, render the Props Data
