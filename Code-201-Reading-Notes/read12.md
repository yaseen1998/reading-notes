# canvas element 

The <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
<br>The <canvas> tag is transparent, and is only a container for graphics, you must use a script to actually draw the graphics.
`<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>`
<br> When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
<br> The `<canvas>` element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦). These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas. 
<br> like for `<video>`, `<audio>`, or `<picture>`
<br> Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the `<canvas>` element

### The rendering context
The `<canvas>` element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown.
