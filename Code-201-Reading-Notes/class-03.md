### Overflowing Content 
The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values
* **hidden** : This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box

* ** scroll** : This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.

### Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
