### Save Images
There are several tools you can use to edit and save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution

* if you have many different colors in a picture you should use a JPEG. 

* Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

### Image Dimensions
The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page

### Cropping Images
When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible

### Image Resolution
Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file
